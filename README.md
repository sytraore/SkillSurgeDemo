# SkillSurgeDemo
This repository is only for **demo purpose only**. The project was completd in **Spring 2025** as a team semester project for a data analysis course.

## About
This is a data analysis project to search for job trends and analyze how companies are investing in AI research, using job openings as a proxy for investment priority or as indicators of skill shortage. By querying the job skills required in numerous posting, we can identify which AI-related skills are in-demand in today's market. This will not only allows us to aid companies in formulating strategies to retain employees but will also serve as a tool used in education to highlight what in-demand skills need to be taught to adequately equip students for the current job market.

### Brief summary of all main conclusions from our entire data science process:

- The Technology sector dominates AI skill demand, particularly for core tools such as Machine Learning, PyTorch, and TensorFlow.
- AI job postings have dramatically increased from 2022 to 2024, especially in the Technology sector, suggesting that AI skillsets are becoming increasingly sought after.
- A strong positive correlation of 0.913 was found between US private AI investment levels and number of job postings from 2022 to 2024, implying that higher investment levels often coincide with increased hiring.
- The Bay Area is a dominant AI job hub, followed by the Northeast, confirming that AI job demand is geographically concentrated and not uniformly distributed.
- AI-related job listings show significant overlap in skill requirements across experience levels, making it difficult to distinguish roles based only on job descriptions.
- Job postings overwhelmingly request bachelor's and master's degrees in fields like Computer Science and Data Science, along with cloud certifications such as AWS and Azure also high in demand.
- Geographic opportunity in AI in uneven as Florida ranks highest in overall opportunity among states while Fremont CA ranks highest in opportunity at the city level. Cities with more park space show higher opportunity while highly walkable cities show a negative correlation.
- Tools like Python, AWS, and TensorFlow are frequently listed alongside many other skills, while peripheral tools/skills appear in more niche contexts.
